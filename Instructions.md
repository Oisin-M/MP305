Python Programs for Modelling I

This web page contains a directory listing various files. These include pdfs of the practical assignments and corresponding 
Python notebook files.

* You can run the Python code via your web browser by clicking on the launch binder logo at the bottom of the web page in the README.md file. (Alternatively, you may download these files and run them on your own laptop or PC if you have Python installed).  
This should (sometimes after a long wait) take you to a Binder directory which contains the same list of files. Clicking on a Python notebook file, such as Network_Flows_I.ipynb, brings you to a Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code in a web browser executable form.

* A Jupyter Python notebook is divided into cells that can be individually executed.  Some cells contain Python code e.g

    In [ ]:  x=5

    while others just contain text. These are called Markdown cells.

* Click the Run button in the menu to execute the code in a cell. Alternatively, use the shortcut: SHIFT+RETURN. (Note that RETURN just adds a blank line of code or converts Markdown text back into Python commented text #....)

* While the code is executing, the prompt In [ ]:  changes to  In [*]:  and when execution is completed becomes In [n]: (where n is the number of executed cells so far).

* You can create new cells or merge cells using the edit tab in the menu. This is very useful when writing code.

* You can restart and/or clear the output of your session using the kernel tab in the menu. This is useful if the program is causing problems. 

* You can download your work as a *.ipynb file and upload it again to continue at a later time using the file tab in the menu. You can also download as a pdf file.

* When you have finished your session, email yourself the *.ipynb file as a way to access the file later on (or else save it to the cloud if you have have that already set up).
